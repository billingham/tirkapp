TirkApp is a Twitter Client because if there is anything in the world every one needs its another twitter client.

I made this because it was the way I wanted to read twitter and it made it easier for me to find stuff that interests me.

The things that make TirkApp stand apart is
1) That it is top->down/past->present display which is what everyone
thought was the right way to read untill twitter convinced everyone otherwise.
2) It runs in a browser.
3) It pushes as much logic to the client as possible.
4) It allows you to add search results to your main feed view no more switching between panes or tabs
5) I like it
